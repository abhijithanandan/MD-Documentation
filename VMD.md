# VMD Basics

## Loading PDB and writing PSF

- The protein data bank is available at [RCSB PDB](https://rcsb.org)
- It contains proteins crystallized with x ray diffraction and nmr spectrosocpy
- **PDB ID :** 4 letter word that identifies each structure in the database
- We can load a Molecule file from the VMD "Molecule file browser" by selecting the appropriate file name.
- Now we can generate a PSF(Protein Structrue File) file using VMD automatic psf loader.
  > Menu > Extension > Modeling > Auto PSF
- Here we need to load the PDB file and topology files.
